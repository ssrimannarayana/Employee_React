    <div>When deciding what to put on a website homepage, the content you end up going with has to be high-value. So, what does high-value content look like? One method we recommend is the Pillar Page as part of a larger SEO pillar strategy. This strategy is a documented hierarchy of planned content to be produced, published, and interlinked on your domain in order to achieve increased search engine rankings. This will enable your homepage to generate more value for your business by generating organic traffic to the website.

So what is a Pillar Page exactly? A Pillar Page is roughly a 3,000-word piece of content that can be put anywhere on your website, but will generate the most value as your main navigation page for visitors. As much value as a Pillar Page and strategy could bring to your online presence, there are still other ways that your company can revitalize your website homepage.</div>
